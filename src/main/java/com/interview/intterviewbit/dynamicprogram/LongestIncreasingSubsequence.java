/**
 * Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given sequence / array.
 * 
 * In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequenceâ€™s
 * elements are in strictly increasing order, and in which the subsequence is as
 * long as possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
 * In this case, we only care about the length of the longest increasing
 * subsequence.
 * 
 * Example :
 * 
 * Input : [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15] Output : 6 The
 * sequence : [0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 13,
 * 15]
